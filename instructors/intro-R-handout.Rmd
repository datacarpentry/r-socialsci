```

This document contains all of the functions that were covered in the
*Introduction to R* workshop. Each function is presented alongside an example of
how it can be used.

## Creating Objects

- `<-` -- "assignment arrow", assigns a value (vector, dataframe, single value)
  to the name of a variable

```{r}

x <- 3
y <- c(1, 2, 3)
z <- x + y
```

- `c()` -- the "concatenate" function combines inputs to form a vector, the
  values have to be the same data type.

```{r}
animals <- c("bird", "cat", "dog")
numbers <- c(1, 14, 57, 89)
logicals <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
```

## Inspecting Objects

- `str()` -- compact display of the structure of an R object

```{r}
str(animals)
```

- `class()` -- returns the type of element of any R object

```{r}
class(logicals)
```

- `typeof()` -- returns the data type or storage mode of any R object

```{r}
typeof(numbers)
```

## Functions in R

- `args()` -- returns the arguments of a function

```{r}
args(round)
```

- named arguments -- the name of the argument the function expects
  - You can choose to not name your arguments, **if** you know the **exact**
    order they should be in!
  - However, we generally discourage this.

```{r}
## Either of these work, since the digits argument is named explicitly.
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
round(digits = 2, 3.14159)

## This does not work, since the arguments are not named and in the incorrect order. 
round(2, 3.14159)
```

## Functions to Summarize Data

- `sqrt()` -- returns the square root of a numeric variable

```{r}
sqrt(numbers)
```

- `mean()` -- returns the mean of a numeric variable
  - You can add the `na.rm` argument, to remove `NA` values before calculating
    the mean.

```{r}
sqrt(numbers)
```

- `max()` -- returns the maximum of a numeric variable
  - You can add the `na.rm` argument, to remove `NA` values before calculating
    the max.

```{r}
sqrt(numbers)
```

- `sum()` -- returns the sum of a numeric variable
  - You can add the `na.rm` argument, to remove `NA` values before calculating
    the sum.

```{r}
sqrt(numbers)
```

- `length()` -- returns the length of a vector (of any datatype)

```{r}
length(animals)
```

## Subsetting Data

- `[]` -- used to subset elements from a vector

```{r}
animals[3]
## selects the third element

animals[2:3]
## selects the second and third element

animals[c(1, 3)]
## selects the first and third element
```

- relational operators -- return logical values indicating where a relation is
  satisfied. The most commonly used logical operators for data analysis are as follows:
  - `==` means "equal to"
  - `!=` means "not equal to"
  - `>` or `<` means "greater than" or "less than"
  - `>=` or `<=` means "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to"

```{r}
animals == "dog"

animals != "cat"

numbers > 4

numbers <= 12
```

- logical operators -- join subset criteria together
  - `&` means "and" -- where two criteria must **both** be satisfied
  - `|` means "or" -- where at least one criteria must be satisfied

```{r}
numbers > 4 & numbers < 20

animals == "dog" | animals == "cat"
```

- `%in%` -- the "inclusion operator", allows you to test if any of the elements
  of a search vector (on the left hand side) are found in the target vector (on
  the right hand side).
  - The levels of the target vector must be included in a vector (`c()`).

```{r}
possessions <- c("car", "bicycle", "radio", "television", "mobile_phone")

possessions %in% c("car", "bicycle", "motorcycle")
```

## Missing Data

- `is.na()` -- returns a vector of logical values indicating which elements of
  a vector have `NA` values
  - Often combined with `!`, where the `!` negates the previous statement (e.g.
    `!TRUE` is equal to `FALSE`).

```{r}
missing <- c(1, 3, NA, 7, 12, NA)

is.na(missing)

!is.na(missing)
```

- `na.omit()` -- removes the observations with `NA` values

```{r}
na.omit(missing)
```

- `complete.cases()` -- returns a vector of logical values indicating which
  elements of a vector **are not** missing (`NA`) values

```{r}
complete.cases(missing)
```
