## What is R? What is RStudio?

The term "`R`" is used to refer to both the programming language and the
software that interprets the scripts written using it.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) is currently a very popular way to not only write
your R scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly,
RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

To make it easier to interact with R, we will use RStudio. RStudio is the most
popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. An IDE is a piece of
software that provides
tools to make programming easier.

## Why learn R?

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that's a good thing

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the
results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing
and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that's a good
thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data,
you don't have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain
your results; you just have to run your script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the
code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and
spot mistakes.

Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are
doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility

Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the
same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.

R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you
collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the
statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be
reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.

### R is interdisciplinary and extensible

With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R
provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many
scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze
your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series,
population genetics, and a lot more.

### R works on data of all shapes and sizes

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether
your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won't make much difference to
you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data
types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your
computer or on the web.

### R produces high-quality graphics

The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any
aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.

### R has a large and welcoming community

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through
mailing lists and websites such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/),
or on the [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/). Questions which
are backed up with [short, reproducible code
snippets](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) are more likely to attract
knowledgeable responses.

### Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform

Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this
transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else)
find some, you can report and fix bugs.

Because R is open source and is supported by a large community of developers and
users, there is a very large selection of third-party add-on packages which are
freely available to extend R's native capabilities.

## A tour of RStudio

## Knowing your way around RStudio

Let's start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the
[Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email
support from RStudio, Inc.

We will use the RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer,
inspect the variables we create, and visualize the plots we generate. RStudio
can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages,
writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information
you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, RStudio
provides many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file
types you use while developing in R. RStudio makes typing easier and less
error-prone.

## Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder called the **working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files. Relative
paths indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to
absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working
this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and
share it with others without having to directly modify file paths in the
individual scripts.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you but also remembers
its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it). The interface also
(optionally) preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to
resume work after a break.

### Create a new project

- Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `New project`
- Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory") and choose a convenient
  location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the
  day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`)
- Click on `Create project`
- Create a new file where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > R
  script. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as
  "`script.R`".

The simplest way to open an RStudio project once it has been created is to
navigate through your files to where the project was saved and double
click on the `.Rproj` (blue cube) file. This will open RStudio and start your R
session in the **same** directory as the `.Rproj` file. All your data, plots and
scripts will now be relative to the project directory. RStudio projects have the
added benefit of allowing you to open multiple projects at the same time each
open to its own project directory. This allows you to keep multiple projects
open without them interfering with each other.

### The RStudio Interface

Let's take a quick tour of RStudio.

![](fig/R_00_Rstudio_01.png){alt='Screenshot of the RStudio\_startup screen'}

RStudio is divided into four "panes". The placement of these
panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options ->
Pane Layout).

The Default Layout is:

- Top Left - **Source**: your scripts and documents
- Bottom Left - **Console**: what R would look and be like without RStudio
- Top Right - **Environment/History**: look here to see what you have done
- Bottom Right - **Files** and more: see the contents of the project/working
  directory here, like your Script.R file

### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized and make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you might
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**. Here
are some examples of suggested directories:

- **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets.
  For the sake of transparency and
  [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you
  should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of
  your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts,
  rather than manually) as possible.
- **`data_output/`** When you need to modify your raw data,
  it might be useful to store the modified versions of the datasets in a
  different folder.
- **`documents/`** Used for outlines, drafts, and other
  text.
- **`fig_output/`** This folder can store the graphics that are generated
  by your scripts.
- **`scripts/`** A place to keep your R scripts for
  different analyses or plotting.

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory.

![](fig/rstudio_project_files.jpeg){alt='Example of a working directory structure'}

### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place
where R will look for and save files. When you write code for your project, your
scripts should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory
and only to files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory
is set up properly. If you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some
reason your working directory is not the same as the location of your RStudio
project, it is likely that you opened an R script or RMarkdown file **not** your
`.Rproj` file. You should close out of RStudio and open the `.Rproj` file by
double clicking on the blue cube! If you ever need to modify your working
directory in a script, `setwd('my/path')` changes the working directory. This
should be used with caution since it makes analyses hard to share across devices
and with other users.

### Downloading the data and getting set up

For this lesson we will use the following folders in our working directory:
**`data/`**, **`data_output/`** and **`fig_output/`**. Let's write them all in
lowercase to be consistent. We can create them using the RStudio interface by
clicking on the "New Folder" button in the file pane (bottom right), or directly
from R by typing at console:

```{r create-dirs, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("data")
dir.create("data_output")
dir.create("fig_output")
```

Go to the Figshare page for this curriculum and download the dataset called
"`SAFI_clean.csv`". The direct download link is:
[https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11492171](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11492171). Place this downloaded file in
the `data/` you just created. You can do this directly from R by copying and
pasting this in your terminal (your instructor can place this chunk of code in
the Etherpad):

```{r download-data, eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11492171",
              "data/SAFI_clean.csv", mode = "wb")
```

## Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to
follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or
*code*, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer
and we can understand. We call the instructions *commands* and we tell the
computer to follow the instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those
commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using
script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in
RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R
language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where
the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type
commands directly into the console and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute those
commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type
the commands we want in the script editor and save the script. This way, there
is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!)
can easily replicate the results on their computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using
the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> shortcut (on Mac, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Return</kbd> will work). The command on the current line in the
script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in
selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. If there is information in the console
you do not need anymore, you can clear it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>.
You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this
[RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rstudio-ide.pdf).

At some point in your analysis, you may want to check the content of a variable
or the structure of an object without necessarily keeping a record of it in
your script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the
console.  RStudio provides the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> and
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> shortcuts allow you to jump between the
script and the console panes.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If R
receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting, or sent from the script editor using
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>), R will try to execute it and, when
ready, will show the results and come back with a new `>` prompt to wait for new
commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more text,
the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering
a complete command. This is likely because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or
quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as
right-parentheses or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.
When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click
inside the console window and press <kbd>Esc</kbd>; this will cancel the
incomplete command and return you to the `>` prompt. You can then proofread
the command(s) you entered and correct the error.

## Installing additional packages using the packages tab

In addition to the core R installation, there are in excess of
10,000 additional packages which can be used to extend the
functionality of R. Many of these have been written by R users and
have been made available in central repositories, like the one
hosted at CRAN, for anyone to download and install into their own R
environment. You should have already installed the packages 'ggplot2'
and 'dplyr. If you have not, please do so now using these instructions.

You can see if you have a package installed by looking in the `packages` tab
(on the lower-right by default). You can also type the command
`installed.packages()` into the console and examine the output.

![](fig/packages_pane.png){alt='Screenshot of Packages pane'}

Additional packages can be installed from the ‘packages' tab.
On the packages tab, click the ‘Install' icon and start typing the
name of the package you want in the text box. As you type, packages
matching your starting characters will be displayed in a drop-down
list so that you can select them.

![](fig/R_00_Rstudio_03.png){alt='Screenshot of Install Packages Window'}

At the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box to
‘Install' dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually
what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality
built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in
the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other
packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install
dependencies' option makes sure that this happens.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise

Use both the Console and the Packages tab to confirm that you have the tidyverse
installed.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Scroll through packages tab down to ‘tidyverse'.  You can also type a few
characters into the searchbox.
The ‘tidyverse' package is really a package of packages, including
'ggplot2' and 'dplyr', both of which require other packages to run correctly.
All of these packages will be installed automatically. Depending on what
packages have previously been installed in your R environment, the install of
‘tidyverse' could be very quick or could take several minutes. As the install
proceeds, messages relating to its progress will be written to the console.
You will be able to see all of the packages which are actually being
installed.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Because the install process accesses the CRAN repository, you
will need an Internet connection to install packages.

It is also possible to install packages from other repositories, as
well as Github or the local file system, but we won't be looking at these options in this lesson.

## Installing additional packages using R code

If you were watching the console window when you started the
install of ‘tidyverse', you may have noticed that the line

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

was written to the console before the start of the installation messages.

You could also have installed the **`tidyverse`** packages by running this command directly at the R terminal.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Use RStudio to write and run R programs.
- Use `install.packages()` to install packages (libraries).
