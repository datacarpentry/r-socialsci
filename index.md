Data Carpentry’s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, 
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in 
less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for 
those interested in working with social sciences data in R.

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no 
programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 
hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the 
RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the 
structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove
rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data 
frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.
