```

This document contains all of the functions that were covered in the
*Introduction to R* workshop. Each function is presented alongside an example of
how it can be used.

All of the examples below are in the context of the Palmer Penguins, found
[here (link)](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html).

## Packages

- `library()` -- loads packages into your `R` session

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Importing Data

- `read_csv()` -- function to import a csv file.
  - First argument is the path to the data, passed as a character
    (inside quotations).
  - You can specify what values should be considered missing, using the `na`
    argument.

```{r}
penguins <- read_csv("data/penguins.csv")
```

## Inspecting Data

- `dim()` - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first element,
  and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
  the object)

```{r}
dim(penguins)
```

- `nrow()` - returns the number of rows
- `ncol()` - returns the number of columns

```{r}
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
```

- `head()` - displays the first 6 rows of the dataframe
- `tail()` - displays the last 6 rows of the dataframe

```{r}
head(penguins)
tail(penguins)
```

- `names()` - returns the all of the names of an object (both row and column)
- `colnames()` - returns column names for dataframes (without row names)

```{r}
names(penguins)
colnames(penguins)
```

- `glimpse()` - provides a preview of the data, where column names are presented
  with their associated data types, and the entries from each column are printed
  in each row

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

- `str()` - returns the structure of the object and information about the class,
  the names and data types of each column, and a preview of the first entries of
  each column

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

- `summary()` - provides summary statistics for each column
  - Note: summary statistics for character variables are not meaningful, as they
    simply state the number of observations (length) of the variable

```{r}
summary(penguins)
```

## Subsetting Data

- `[]` -- selects rows and columns from a dataframe
  - The first entry is the row number, the second entry is the column number(s),
    and they are separated with a comma.

```{r}
## Selects the element in the first row, second column
penguins[1, 2]

## Selects every element in the fourth row
penguins[4, ]

## Selects every element in the third column
penguins[, 3]
```

- `[[]]` -- selects a column from a dataframe
  - Inside the brackets you can pass either the number of the column or the
    name of the column (in quotations)

```{r}
penguins[[1]]

penguins[["island"]]
```

- `$` -- selects a column from a dataframe, where the name of the dataframe is
  on the left and the name of the column is on the right

```{r}
penguins$body_mass_g
```

## Working with Different Data Types

- `factor()` -- creates a categorical variable from a character or numeric
  variable, variable has a factor datatype
  - the values (level) of the factor levels is specified in the `levels`
    argument, where the levels must be specified in a vector (using `c()`)
  - Note: the order you wish for the levels to appear is how you should list
    them in the `levels` argument, you can also specify `ordered = TRUE` to
    ensure the levels remain in this order

```{r}
penguins$year_fct <- factor(penguins$year, 
                               levels = c("2007", "2008", "2009"), 
                            ordered = TRUE)
```

- `as.factor()` -- creates a categorical variable from a character or numeric
  variable, variable has a factor datatype
  - does not allow for you to specify the order of the levels
  - defaults to alphabetical ordering for factor levels

```{r}
penguins$year_fct <- as.factor(penguins$year)
```

- `levels()` -- returns the levels of a variable with a factor datatype, in the
  order they were stored
  - Note: this function will not work for character datatypes

```{r}
levels(penguins$year_fct)
```

- `nlevels()` -- returns the number of levels of a variable with a factor
  datatype
  - Note: this function will not work for character datatypes

```{r}
nlevels(penguins$year_fct)
```

- `as.character()` -- creates a character variable from a numeric or factor
  variable

```{r}
penguins$species_chr <- as.character(penguins$species)
```

- `ymd()` -- transforms dates stored as character or numeric variables to dates
  - Note: to use this function, dates must be stored in year-month-day format
  - The function does well with heterogeneous formats (as seen below), but
    formats where some of the entries are not in double digits may not be parsed
    correctly.

```{r}
x <- c("2009-01-01", "2009-01-02", "2009-01-03")
ymd(x)
```

- `day()` -- extracts the day (number) of a date variable

```{r}
day(x)
```

- `month()` -- extracts the month (number) of a date variable

```{r}
month(x)
```

- `year()` -- extracts the year of a date variable

```{r}
year(x)
```

## Visualizing Data

- `plot()` -- a generic function for plotting R objects
  - In this lesson `plot()` was used to create bargraphs of categorical
    variables.

```{r}
plot(penguins$species)
```
