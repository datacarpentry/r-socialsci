# Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

**`dplyr`** is a package for making tabular data manipulation easier by using a limited set of functions that can be combined to extract and summarize insights from your data. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables you to swiftly convert between different data formats (long vs. wide) for plotting and analysis.

Similarly to **`readr`**, **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** are also part of the tidyverse. These packages were loaded in R's memory when we called `library(tidyverse)` earlier.

## What is an R package?

An R package is a complete unit for sharing code with others. Each R package contains the code for a set of R functions, the documentation (or description) for each of the functions, as well as a practice dataset to learn the functions on. 

Generally, each R package is built with a specific task in mind. For instance, the package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++) (not all R packages are written in R!). 

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups. Moving back and forth between these formats is nontrivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you tools for this and more sophisticated  data manipulation.

But there are also packages available for a wide range of tasks including building plots (**`ggplot2`**, which we'll see later), downloading data from the NCBI database, or performing statistical analysis on your data set. Many packages such as these are housed on, and downloadable from, the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN) using `install.packages`. This function makes the package accessible by your R installation with the command `library()`, as you did with `tidyverse` earlier.

To easily access the documentation for a package within R or RStudio, use `help(package = "package_name")`.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want to check out this
[handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and this [one about **`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

## Learning **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

To make sure, everyone will use the same dataset for this lesson, we'll read again the SAFI dataset that we downloaded earlier.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE, message=FALSE}

## load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

interviews <- read_csv("data/SAFI_clean.csv", na = "NULL")

## inspect the data
interviews

## preview the data
# View(interviews)
```

We're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a
data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data
frame (`interviews`), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(interviews, village, no_membrs, years_liv)
```

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(interviews, village == "God")
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews2 <- filter(interviews, village == "God")
interviews_god <- select(interviews2, no_membrs, years_liv)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews_god <- select(filter(interviews, village == "God"), no_membrs, years_liv)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the
output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when
you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R look like `%>%` and
are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically with
**`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(village == "God") %>%
    select(no_membrs, years_liv)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `interviews` dataset first
through `filter()` to keep rows where `village` is "God", then through
`select()` to keep only the `no_membrs` and `years_liv` columns. Since `%>%`
takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function
on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument
to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we take the data frame `interviews`, *then* we `filter`
for rows with `village == "God"`, *then* we `select` columns `no_membrs` and `years_liv`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple,
but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish
more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews_god <- interviews %>%
    filter(village == "God") %>%
    select(no_membrs, years_liv)

interviews_god
```

Note that the final data frame (`interviews_god`) is the leftmost part of this expression.

> > interviews %>%
> >     filter(memb_assoc == "yes") %>%
> >     select(affect_conflicts, liv_count, no_meals)

{: .challenge}

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in
two columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

We might be interested in the ratio of number of household members
to rooms used for sleeping (i.e. avg number of people per room):

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    mutate(people_per_room = no_membrs / rooms)
```

We may be interested in investigating whether being a member of an
irrigation association had any effect on the ratio of household members
to rooms. To look at this relationship, we will first remove
data from our dataset where the respondent didn't answer the
question of whether they were a member of an irrigation association.
These cases are recorded as "NULL" in the dataset.

To remove these cases, we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    mutate(people_per_room = no_membrs / rooms)
```

The `!` symbol negates the result, so we're asking for every row where
`memb_assoc` *is not* missing..

>  Create a new data frame from the `interviews` data that meets the following

> >     filter(total_meals > 20) %>%
> >     select(village, total_meals)
> > ```

{: .challenge}

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine*
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of
the `group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the average household size by village:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn't run off the
screen anymore. It's one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))
```

Note that the output is a grouped tibble. To obtain an ungrouped tibble, use the `ungroup` function:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs)) %>%
    ungroup()
```

When grouping both by `village` and `membr_assoc`, we see rows in our table for
respondents who did not specify whether they were a member of an irrigation
association. We can exclude those data from our table using a filter step.


```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum household size for each village for each group
(members of an irrigation association vs not):

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),
              min_membrs = min(no_membrs))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_membrs` to put the group
with the smallest household first:


```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs), min_membrs = min(no_membrs)) %>%
    arrange(min_membrs)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of minimum household size:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),
              min_membrs = min(no_membrs)) %>%
    arrange(desc(min_membrs))
```

#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each village, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    count(village)
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument to get results in decreasing order:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    count(village, sort = TRUE)
```

## Reshaping with pivot_wider and pivot_longer

In the [spreadsheet
lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheets-socialsci/), we discussed how
to structure our data leading to the four rules defining a tidy dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a table.

In `interviews`, each row contains the values of variables associated with each
record (the unit), values such as the number of household members or possessions
associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we wanted to
look at differences in households grouped by different types of housing
construction materials?

We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised
of values of variables associated with each housing material (e.g. for
`respondent_wall_type`). In practical terms this means the values
of the wall construction materials in `respondent_wall_type` would
become the names of column variables and the cells would contain `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Having created a new table, we can now explore the relationship within and
between household types--for example we could compare the ratio of household
members to sleeping rooms grouped by type of construction material. The key
point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure, but we have
**reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of
a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions, `pivot_wider()`
and `pivot_longer()`.

### Pivoting wider

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the data
2. the *names_from* column variable whose values will become new column names.
3. the *values_from* column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.

Further arguments include `values_fill` which, if set, fills in missing values with
the value provided.

Let's use `pivot_wider()` to transform interviews to create new columns for each type
of wall construction material. We use the pipe as before too. Because both the
`names_from` and `values_from` parameters must come from column values, we will create a
dummy column (we'll name it `wall_type_logical`) to hold the value `TRUE`, which
we will then place into the appropriate column that corresponds to the wall
construction material for that respondent. When using `mutate()` if you give a
single value, it will be used for all observations in the dataset. 

For each row in our newly pivoted table, only one of the newly created wall type columns will be `TRUE`. The default value that `pivot_wider` uses to fill the other wall types is `NA`.

![](../fig/pivot_long_to_wide.png)


Instead of the default value of `NA`, we want them to be `FALSE`. We will use `values_fill = list(wall_type_logcial = FALSE)` in `pivot_wider()` to fill the rest of the new columns for that row with `FALSE`.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_wide <- interviews %>%
    mutate(wall_type_logical = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = respondent_wall_type, 
                values_from = wall_type_logical, 
                values_fill = list(wall_type_logical = FALSE))
```


View the `interviews_wide` data frame and notice that there is no longer a
column titled `respondent_wall_type`. This is because there is a default
parameter in `pivot_wider()` that drops the original column. The values that were
in that column have now become variables `muddaub`, `burntbricks`, `sunbricks`, and 
`cement`.
You can use `dim(interviews)` and `dim(interviews_spread)` to compare the 
number of columns.



### Pivoting longer

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the form
of `interviews_wide`, where the building materials are column names, but we
wish to treat them as values of a `respondent_wall_type` variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them into a pair
of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values, and the
other variable contains the values previously associated with the column names.
We will do this in two steps to make this process a bit clearer.

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the data
2. *cols* are the names of the columns we use to fill the values variable (or to drop).
3. the *names_to* column variable we wish to create from column names.
4. the *values_to* column variable we wish to create and fill with values
associated with the named columns.

To recreate our original data frame, we will use the following:

1. the data - `interviews_wide`
2. the *cols* are the names of the columns that are to be reshaped;
   in this case, they are specified in a list using `c()`.
3. the *names_to* column will be "respondent_wall_type" (as a character string). This
   is the name of the new column we want to create.
4. the *values_to* column will be "wall_type_logical" (as a character string). 
   This will be populated with either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_long <- interviews_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = c(burntbricks, cement, muddaub, sunbricks),
                 names_to = "respondent_wall_type", 
                 values_to = "wall_type_logical")
```


![](../fig/pivot_wide_to_long.png)

This creates a data frame with `r nrow(interviews_long)` rows (4 rows per interview respondent). The four rows for each respondent differ only in the value of the "respondent_wall_type" and "wall_type_logical" columns. View the data to see what this looks like.

Only one row for each interview respondent is informative--we know that if the
house walls are made of "sunbrick" they aren't made of any other the other
materials. Therefore, we can filter our dataset to only keep values where
`wall_type_logical` is `TRUE`. Because `wall_type_logical` is already either
`TRUE` or `FALSE`, when passing the column name to `filter()`, it will
automatically already only keep rows where this column has the value `TRUE`. We
can then remove the `wall_type_logical` column. We do all of these steps
together in the next chunk of code:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_long <- interviews_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = c(burntbricks, cement, muddaub, sunbricks),
                 names_to = "respondent_wall_type", 
                 values_to = "wall_type_logical") %>%
    filter(wall_type_logical) %>%
    select(-wall_type_logical)
```

View both `interviews_long` and `interviews_wide` and compare their
structure. 


## Applying `pivot_wider()` to clean our data

Now that we've learned about `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` we're going to put these
functions to use to fix a problem with the way that our data is structured. In
the spreadsheets lesson, we learned that it's best practice to have only a
single piece of information in each cell of your spreadsheet. In this dataset,
we have several columns which contain multiple pieces of information. For
example, the `items_owned` column contains information about whether our
respondents owned a fridge, a television, etc. To make this data easier to
analyze, we will split this column and create a new column for each item. Each
cell in that column will either be `TRUE` or `FALSE` and will indicate whether
that interview respondent owned that item.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned <- interviews %>%
    separate_rows(items_owned, sep=";") %>%
    mutate(items_owned_logical = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned, 
                values_from = items_owned_logical, 
                values_fill = list(items_owned_logical = FALSE))

nrow(interviews_items_owned)
```

There are a couple of new concepts in this code chunk. Let's walk through it
line by line. First we create a new object (`interviews_items_owned`) based on
the `interviews` dataframe.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned <- interviews %>%
```

Then we use the new function `separate_rows()` from the **`tidyr`** package to split the column `items_owned`
based on the presence of semi-colons (`;`). This creates a long format version of the dataset, which has multiple rows for each respondent, each row with a unique item. For example, if a respondent has a television and a solar panel, that respondent will now have two rows, one with "television" and the other with "solar panel" in the `items_owned` column.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
separate_rows(items_owned, sep=";") %>%
```

Lastly, we use `pivot_wider()` to switch from long format to wide format. This
creates a new column for each of the unique values in the `split_items` column,
and fills those columns with `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mutate(items_owned_logical = TRUE) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned,
            values_from = items_owned_logical,
            values_fill = list(items_owned_logical = FALSE))
```

View the `interviews_items_owned` data frame. It should have 
`r nrow(interviews)` rows (the same number of rows you had originally), but extra
columns for each item. 

You may notice that one of the columns in called `\`<NA>\`. This is because the respondents did not own any of the items that was in the interviewer's list. We can use the `rename()` function to change this name to something more meaningful:

```{r}
interviews_items_owned <- interviews_items_owned %>%
    rename(no_listed_items = `NA`)
```

This format of the data allows us to do interesting things, like make a table
showing the number of respondents in each village who owned a particular item:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned %>%
    filter(bicycle) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    count(bicycle)
```

Or calculate the average number of items from the list owned
by respondents in each village:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_items_owned %>%
    mutate(number_items = rowSums(select(., bicycle:television))) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    summarize(mean_items = mean(number_items))
```

## Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data_output`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want
to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good
practice to keep them separate. The `data` folder should only contain the raw,
unaltered data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify
it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data_output`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always
re-generate them.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to create a
version of the dataset where each of the columns includes only one
data value. To do this, we will use `pivot_wider` to expand the
`months_lack_food` and `items_owned` columns. We will also create a couple of summary columns.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
interviews_plotting <- interviews %>%
    ## pivot wider by items_owned
    separate_rows(items_owned, sep=";") %>%
    mutate(items_owned_logical = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned, 
                values_from = items_owned_logical, 
                values_fill = list(items_owned_logical = FALSE)) %>%
    rename(no_listed_items = `NA`) %>%
    ## pivot wider by months_lack_food
    separate_rows(months_lack_food, sep=";") %>%
    mutate(months_lack_food_logical = TRUE) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = months_lack_food, 
                values_from = months_lack_food_logical, 
                values_fill = list(months_lack_food_logical = FALSE)) %>%
    ## add some summary columns
    mutate(number_months_lack_food = rowSums(select(., Jan:May))) %>%
    mutate(number_items = rowSums(select(., bicycle:car)))
```

Now we can save this data frame to our `data_output` directory.

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(interviews_plotting, path = "data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
```

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if (!dir.exists("data_output")) dir.create("data_output")
write_csv(interviews_plotting, path = "data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
```
