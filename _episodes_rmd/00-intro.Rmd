## R and RStudio

R is an open source programming language originally designed and
implemented by statisticians primarily for statistical analysis.
It includes high quality graphics capabilities and tools for basic
data analysis and reading and writing data to/from files.

Because R is open source and is supported by a large community of
developers and users there is a very large selection of third party
add-on libraries which are freely available and can easily be added
to the core R system making even more analysis techniques readily
available.

R is a scripted language. Rather than pointing and clicking in a
GUI environment you write code statements to ask R to do something
for you. This has the advantage of providing a permanent record of
what was done and allows for peer review of the work undertaken.

Having this written record, something which is increasingly
required as part of a publication submission, is also an aid when
seeking help with problems.

There are many online resources such as [stackoverflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
which will allow you to seek help from the online R community. You
can search in the normal Internet way of doing things by providing
keywords in a free format search request, but you can also post
specific questions. Questions which are backed up with code
snippets are more likely to attract knowledgeable responses.

Although R is a scripted language, there is still a place for the
GUI (Graphical User Interface). The most popular R GUI currently is
RStudio. We will be using RStudio throughout this lesson. RStudio
acts as a front-end to the R environment. For this workshop. we
need to install both R and R Studio.

In the remainder of this episode we will go through the steps of
installing first R and then RStudio and finish with a brief tour of
some of the RStudio facilities.

## Installing R

The latest version of R can be downloaded from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
You will find download links for Linux, Mac and Windows versions of
R. You should choose the environment appropriate to your machine's
operating system. In each case you will be guided to a particular
download for your machine.

Having completed the download, you should install using the normal
technique for your operating environment. If you are using a
Windows machine you can double click the downloaded executable
file.  You can accepts the defaults for all of the option presented by the
install wizard. By default both the 32 and 64 bit versions of R
will be installed and icons for them will be available on your
desktop.

These icons are in fact for a simple R GUI called RGui. It will
allow you to create and run R Scripts among other things, but it is
not as sophisticated as RStudio.

## Installing RStudio


The latest version of RStudio can be downloaded from the
[RStudio.com]( https://www.rstudio.com/) website. Like R, there are
versions for Mac, Linux, and Windows. Select the one you need,
download the file, and install it in the usual manner for your
operating system. You can accept the defaults for all of the
options presented by the install wizard.

In the latest versions of Windows, RStudio is not automatically
placed on the desktop. To start RStudio in Windows, type ‘RStudio’
into the search bar by the Windows Start icon in the bottom left
hand corner of the screen. When the desktop app appears in the list
of programs you can run it directly by selecting it or you can
choose to have the icon added to the Start menu or taskbar.

## A tour of RStudio

When you first open RStudio you will be presented with a display
similar to this;

![Rstudio_startup](../fig/R_00_Rstudio_01.png)

On the righthand side there are two tabbed panes. The pane at the
top allows you to see either a history of all of the commands which
have been run previously (it even remembers across sessions).  You
can select any command and have it copied across into the console
area on the left from where you can run it again by hitting the
enter key. The Environment tab allows you to see all of the
variables which exist in your current session. You can see the
variable names, see what data types they are and see some of the
values.  This can be useful for a quick check on variable contents.
There are a set of R commands which you can run from the console to
provide more complete information.

The bottom pane on the right has five tabs.

* Files – contents of the current working directory. This defaults in Windows to the Documents folder.  You can change it from the menu items for the tab, or more likely it will change when you create a project with its own folder as we will be doing later.
* Plots – This tab will display any graphic output you produce. There are forward and back buttons allowing you to see previous plots from the session and there are options to export the graphic to an external file.
* Packages – This is a list of all of the packages installed in your R environment and an indication of whether they are currently loaded in your RStudio session. There are options for installing additional packages from CRAN or updating existing packages. Both of which will require you to have an Internet connection.
* Viewer – This is used to display HTML files.
* Help -  The initial help page provides a set of links to a variety of Help related topics.

![Help](../fig/R_00_Rstudio_02.png).

These include basic manuals on R  as well as reference materials on
the installed packages. The RStudio Cheat Sheets are small pdf
documents which can be downloaded and provide summary information
on how to use key packages in R like dplyr and ggplot2 both of
which we will be using extensively in this lesson.
In the toolbar there is a search text box where you can type what you are looking for.

### Creating a Script file

In order to follow along with the examples in this episode you
should start RStudio and create a new RScript file either from the
File menu item or the toolbar icon immediately below it. Click the
save icon on your toolbar and save your script as "datacarpentry-workshop.R".

Although we will routinely refer to using the console in this
episode, and you can in fact type all of the code directly into the
console, we will assume that you will write all of your code to the
script file first and then select the code and either click the
'run' button on the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut of
'ctrl+Enter' (or 'command+Enter' on Mac).

There are shortcut alternatives to many of the RStudio menu and
toolbar items. The RStudio article
[Editing and Executing Code](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484448-Editing-and-Executing-Code)
explains many of them.

When you select code for execution be careful that you either
select the whole line or lines or if you are just running a single
line, simply place the cursor in the line. If you select only a
portion of a line, that is all that will be run.

In this lesson we we be using the SAFI dataset that we have
been using in the other parts of this workshop. To download the
data and see more information about the data, visit the [workshop homepage](https://www.datacarpentry.org/socialsci-workshop/data/).

Download the data file and place it in the directory where you
will be doing your R work.

## Installing additional packages using the packages tab
In addition to the core R installation there are in excess of
10,000 additional packages which can be used to extend the
functionality of R. Many of these have been written by R users and
have been made available in central repositories, like the one
hosted at CRAN for anyone to download and install into their own R
environment. In the course of this lesson we will be making use of
several of these packages such as 'ggplot2' and 'dplyr'.

Additional packages can be installed from the ‘packages’ tab.
On the packages tab click the ‘Install’ icon and start typing the
name of the package you want in the text box. As you type packages
matching your starting characters will be displayed in a drop down
list from where it can be selected.

![Install Packages Window](../fig/R_00_Rstudio_03.png)

At the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box for
‘Install’ dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually
what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality
built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in
the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other
packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install
dependencies’ option makes sure that this happens.

> ## Exercise
> Use the install option from the packages tab to install the ‘tidyverse’ package.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > From the packages tab, click ‘Install’ from the toolbar and type ‘tidyverse’ into the textbox then click ‘install’
> > The ‘tidyverse’ package is really a package of packages, including 'ggplot2' and 'dplyr', both of which require other packages to run correctly. All of these packages will be installed automatically. 
> > Depending on what packages have previously been installed in your R environment, the install of ‘tidyverse’ could be very quick or could take several minutes.
> > As the install proceeds messages relating to the progress will be written to the console. You will be able to see all of the packages which are actually being installed.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Because the install process accesses the repository at CRAN, you
will need an Internet connection to install packages in this way.

It is also possible to install packages from other repositories as
well as Github or the local file system, but we won’t be looking at these options in this lesson.

## Installing additional packages using R code

If you were watching the console window when you starting the
install of ‘tidyverse’ you may have noticed that before the start
of the installation messages, the line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

was written to the console. 

This is standard R code. The function `install.packages()` is
called and passed a single parameter, which is the name of the
package you want to install. Rather than using the Rstudio GUI
functionality, you can write the code yourself in the console or
include it as part of a script.
