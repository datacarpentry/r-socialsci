# r-socialsci

Lesson on R for social scientists. Please see [https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) for a rendered version of this lesson. 

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). The lessons cover some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.

The [instructor notes page](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/guide/index.html) have some tips about how to best teach this workshop.
